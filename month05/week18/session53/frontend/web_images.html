these space fliers were men, and 69 were women. The longest time spent in space on one mission is
the 438 days spent aboard the Russian space station Mir by cosmonaut Valery Polyakov in 1994–95."

        "Astronaut" technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of
        nationality. However, astronauts fielded by Russia or the Soviet Union are
        typically known instead as cosmonauts (from the Russian "kosmos" (космос),
        meaning "space", also borrowed from Greek).
